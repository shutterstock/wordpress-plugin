**Prerequisites**

By default, WordPress sites have access to a limited library of Shutterstock media. **To connect the WordPress plugin to your existing subscription or access our full collection, fill out the form at [https://www.shutterstock.com/design/plugins-wordpress](https://www.shutterstock.com/design/plugins-wordpress).**

To install the Shutterstock plugin for WordPress, you need an API application for the Shutterstock API. You can create an application at [https://www.shutterstock.com/account/developers/apps](https://www.shutterstock.com/account/developers/apps).

The plugin works only with API applications that have referrer authentication enabled. In your application, you must specify the host names on which your WordPress site runs.

To add referrer authentication to your app:

1. Go to [https://shutterstock.com/account/developers/apps](https://shutterstock.com/account/developers/apps).
1. Create or edit an app you want to use with the plugin.
1. In the **Referrer** field, specify a comma-separated list of host names that the WordPress server runs on.
You can specify "localhost" as a referrer for local testing.
1. Make sure that each referrer host name is also listed in the **Callback URL** field.
1. Save the app and note the consumer key and consumer secret.

To set up the plugin in WordPress, you also need:

- WordPress version 5.5 or later
- An account on the WordPress server with administrator access
- A Shutterstock subscription that is enabled for API use; see [Subscriptions](https://api-reference.shutterstock.com/#subscriptions) in the Shutterstock API documentation.

**Installing**

To install the Shutterstock plugin for WordPress, follow these steps:

1. Log in to WordPress as a user with the Administrator role.
1. In the WordPress admin console, click **Plugins > Add New**.
1. In the Add Plugins window, search for the Shutterstock plugin, click **Install Now**, and then click **Activate**.

   As an alternative, you can download the latest release of the plugin from [https://wordpress.org/plugins/](https://wordpress.org/plugins/) and install it manually by going to the Add Plugins window, clicking **Upload Plugin**, selecting the plugin file, clicking **Install Now**, and then clicking **Activate Plugin**.

1. In the WordPress admin console, go to **Settings > Shutterstock**.
1. Put your API application's consumer key in the **API Key** field and its consumer secret in the **API Secret** field.
1. Click **Log in with Shutterstock** and log in with the user name and password of the Shutterstock account that you want to use to access the Shutterstock media library. Now the plugin has a token that it can use to access the library.

1. In the **Editorial Country** field, enter the three-character country code for editorial content, such as USA or DEU.
1. In the **User Settings** table, select which WordPress roles have access to search and license media.
1. Click **Save Changes**.

**Adding media to the WordPress library**

You can search and download media directly from the WordPress admin console into your site's media library by clicking **Media > Shutterstock**. From this page you can search for images, license images, and redownload previously licensed images if your subscriptions allows redownloads.

**Adding media to pages and posts**

Now that you have the Shutterstock plugin installed and configured, you can use it to add Shutterstock media to your pages and posts:

1. Open a post or page in the WordPress editor.
1. Add a Shutterstock block.

   ![Shutterstock block added to the page](browse_button.png)

1. In the new block, click **Browse**.
1. In the popup window, search Shutterstock's library for media to add.
You can click **View recommendations** to see suggested images based on the text of your blog post or page.

   You can also go to the **Downloads** tab to see images that you have already licensed.
   The images that are available for redownload depend on the subscription that the plugin is using; to connect the plugin to your subscription, fill out the form at [https://www.shutterstock.com/design/plugins-wordpress](https://www.shutterstock.com/design/plugins-wordpress).

1. To try a piece of media in your page, click its **Insert Preview** button. WordPress adds a watermarked preview of the image to your page.

   ![Watermarked preview on the page](watermarked_preview.png)

1. To license the image and put the non-watermarked image on the page, click **License this image**, select your plan and size, and click **License**. The Shutterstock plugin downloads the media to the default media upload folder for WordPress. You can see the image in the WordPress Media tab.
1. In the block settings, update the alt text and dimensions of the image. Other block settings allow you to set HTML attributes including the title, anchor, and class.

   ![Watermarked preview on the page](inserted_image.png)

1. Publish the page as usual. The image appears on the page just like any other image that you add to a page.
